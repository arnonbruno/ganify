<b> Installation: </b>
One can easily install GANify using the PIP:

<b> Other info: </b>
The package also enables the creation of synthetic data using both <b> GANs </b> and <b> WGANs </b>, by simply changing the argument <i>"type"</i> on <i>"fit_data"</i>
Additionally, you can view the model overall loss performance by calling the <i>"plot_performance()"</i> method after fit.
